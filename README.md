Designing and Developing is my passion. I am the most proficient in the development stack, but I am a fast learner and pick up concepts quickly in order to get the job done. I also have experience with PHP in relation to Content Management Systems and HTML/CSS experience posting and updating user content for platforms like  WordPress.
I'd love to talk about how my empathy-first approach to development can make a huge difference in your organization! Looking forward to connecting with anyone who is willing to give me a chance or has leads :)
